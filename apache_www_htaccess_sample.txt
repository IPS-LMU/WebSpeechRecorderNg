# Example Apache WWW .htaccess file
#
# WebSpeechRecorderNg is based on Angular https://angular.io
# Therefore it is a single page appliaction (SPA) and requires a special server configuration,
# which redirects (virtual) routing paths to the index.html page of the application.
# See https://angular.io/guide/deployment#server-configuration for details.
#
# In this example the deploy path /wsr/ng/ was chosen.
# The build command for the app is accordingly:
# ng build --base-href=/wsr/ng/dist/index.html --prod
# The dist directory can then be deployed (copied) to a directory /wsr/ng/ on your Web-Server
# and this file should be copied to /wsr/ng/dist/.htaccess
